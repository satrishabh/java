 * Predecessor and Successor
 * EasyAccuracy: 46.01%Submissions: 48436Points: 2
 * There is BST given with root node with key part as an integer only. You need to find the in-order successor and predecessor of a given key. If either predecessor or successor is not found, then set it to NULL.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * 2
 * 6
 * 50 30 L 30 20 L 30 40 R 50 70 R 70 60 L 70 80 R
 * 65
 * 6
 * 50 30 L 30 20 L 30 40 R 50 70 R 70 60 L 70 80 R
 * 100
 *
 * Output:
 * 60 70
 * 80 -1
 * Input:
 * The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains n denoting the number of edges of the BST. The next line contains the edges of the BST. The last line contains the key.
 *
 * Output:
 * Find the predecessor and successor of the key in BST and sets pre and suc as predecessor and successor, respectively Otherwise, set to NULL.
 *
 * Your Task: You don't need to print anything. You only need to set p.pre to the predecessor and s.succ to the successor. p and s have been passed in the function parameter.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1<=T<=100
 * 1<=n<=100
 * 1<=data of node<=100
 * 1<=key<=100
