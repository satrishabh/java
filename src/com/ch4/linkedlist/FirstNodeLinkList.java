/**
 * Find first node of loop in a linked list
 *
 * Difficulty Level : Medium
 * Last Updated : 26 Jul, 2022
 * Write a function findFirstLoopNode() that checks whether a given Linked List contains a loop. If the loop is present then it returns point to the first node of the loop. Else it returns NULL.
 *
 * Example :
 *
 * Input : Head of below linked list
 *
 *
 * Output : Pointer to node 2
 * Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
 * We have discussed Floydâ€™s loop detection algorithm. Below are steps to find the first node of the loop.
 * 1. If a loop is found, initialize a slow pointer to head, let fast pointer be at its position.
 * 2. Move both slow and fast pointers one node at a time.
 * 3. The point at which they meet is the start of the loop.
