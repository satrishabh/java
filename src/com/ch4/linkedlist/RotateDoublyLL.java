 * Rotate Doubly linked list by N nodes
 *
 * Difficulty Level : Easy
 * Last Updated : 05 Aug, 2022
 * Given a doubly-linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by N nodes. Here N is a given positive integer and is smaller than the count of nodes in linked list.
 *
 *
 *
 * N = 2
 * Rotated List:
 *
 *
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input : a  b  c  d  e   N = 2
 * Output : c  d  e  a  b
 *
 * Input : a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h   N = 4
 * Output : e  f  g  h  a  b  c  d

 * Recommended PracticeRotate doubly Linked ListTry It!
 * To rotate the Doubly linked list, first, we need to traverse through the linked list and find the address of the last node.
 * Then make it a circular linked list.
 * Then move the head as well as a temp by n nodes.
 * Then make the linked list as un-circular.
