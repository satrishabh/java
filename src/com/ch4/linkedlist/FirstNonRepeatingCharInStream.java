 *
 * Given an input stream of A of n characters consisting only of lower case alphabets. The task is to find the first non repeating character, each time a character is inserted to the stream. If there is no such character then append '#' to the answer.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: A = "aabc"
 * Output: "a#bb"
 * Explanation: For every character first non
 * repeating character is as follow-
 * "a" - first non-repeating character is 'a'
 * "aa" - no non-repeating character so '#'
 * "aab" - first non-repeating character is 'b'
 * "aabc" - first non-repeating character is 'b'
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: A = "zz"
 * Output: "z#"
 * Explanation: For every character first non
 * repeating character is as follow-
 * "z" - first non-repeating character is 'z'
 * "zz" - no non-repeating character so '#'
 *
 *
 * Your Task:
 * You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function FirstNonRepeating() which takes A as input parameter and returns a string after processing the input stream.
 *
 *
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(26 * n)
 * Expected Space Complexity: O(26)
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= n <= 105
