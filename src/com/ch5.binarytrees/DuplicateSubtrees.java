/**
 * Duplicate Subtrees
 * MediumAccuracy: 43.37%Submissions: 26814Points: 4
 * Given a binary tree of size N, your task is to that find all duplicate subtrees from the given binary tree.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input :
 *
 * Output : 2 4
 *          4
 * Explanation: Above Trees are two
 * duplicate subtrees.i.e  and
 * Therefore,you need to return above trees
 * root in the form of a list.
 * Your Task:
 * You don't need to take input. Just complete the function printAllDups() that takes the root node as a parameter and returns an array of Node*, which contains all the duplicate subtree.
 * Note: Here the Output of every Node printed in the Pre-Order tree traversal format.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1<=T<=100
 * 1<=N<=100
