 *
 * Given two strings S and P. Find the smallest window in the string S consisting of all the characters(including duplicates) of the string P.  Return "-1" in case there is no such window present. In case there are multiple such windows of same length, return the one with the least starting index.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * S = "timetopractice"
 * P = "toc"
 * Output:
 * toprac
 * Explanation: "toprac" is the smallest
 * substring in which "toc" can be found.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:
 * S = "zoomlazapzo"
 * P = "oza"
 * Output:
 * apzo
 * Explanation: "apzo" is the smallest
 * substring in which "oza" can be found.
 * Your Task:
 * You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function smallestWindow() which takes two string S and P as input paramters and returns the smallest window in string S having all the characters of the string P. In case there are multiple such windows of same length, return the one with the least starting index.
 *
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
 * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 ≤ |S|, |P| ≤ 105
