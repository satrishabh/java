/**
 * A Program to check if strings are rotations of each other or not
 *
 * Difficulty Level : Easy
 * Last Updated : 29 Jul, 2022
 * Given a string s1 and a string s2, write a snippet to say whether s2 is a rotation of s1?
 * (eg given s1 = ABCD and s2 = CDAB, return true, given s1 = ABCD, and s2 = ACBD , return false)
 *
 * Algorithm: areRotations(str1, str2)
 *
 * string, S1 is equal to A B, C D

 * 1. Create a temp string and store concatenation of str1 to
 *    str1 in temp.
 *                       temp = str1.str1
 * 2. If str2 is a substring of temp then str1 and str2 are
 *    rotations of each other.
 *
 * Example:
 *                  str1 = "ABACD"
 *                  str2 = "CDABA"
 *
 *  temp = str1.str1 = "ABACDABACD"
 *  Since str2 is a substring of temp, str1 and str2 are
 *  rotations of each other.
 * Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
