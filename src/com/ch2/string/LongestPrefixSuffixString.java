 *
 * Given a string of characters, find the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a proper suffix.
 *
 * NOTE: Prefix and suffix can be overlapping but they should not be equal to the entire string.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "abab"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: "ab" is the longest proper
 * prefix and suffix.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "aaaa"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: "aaa" is the longest proper
 * prefix and suffix.
 * Your task:
 * You do not need to read any input or print anything. The task is to complete the function lps(), which takes a string as input and returns an integer.
 *
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|)
 * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|s|)
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105
 * s contains lower case English alphabets
