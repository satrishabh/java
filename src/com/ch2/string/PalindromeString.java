 * EasyAccuracy: 50.77%Submissions: 100k+Points: 2
 * Given a string S, check if it is palindrome or not.
 *
 * Example 1:

 * Explanation: S is a palindrome
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: S = "abc"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: S is not a palindrome
 *
 *
 * Your Task:
 * You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function isPalindrome()which accepts string S and returns an integer value 1 or 0.
 *
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(Length of S)
 * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= Length of S<= 10^5
