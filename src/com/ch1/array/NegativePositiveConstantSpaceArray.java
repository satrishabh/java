 * An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.
 *
 * Examples :
 *
 * Input: -12, 11, -13, -5, 6, -7, 5, -3, -6
 * Output: -12 -13 -5 -7 -3 -6 11 6 5
 *
 * Note: Order of elements is not important here.
 *
 * Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
 * Naive approach: The idea is to sort the array of elements, this will make sure that all the negative elements will come before all the positive elements.
 * Below is the implementation of the above approach:
