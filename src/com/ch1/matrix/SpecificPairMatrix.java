 * Find a specific pair in Matrix

 * Difficulty Level : Hard
 * Last Updated : 30 Jun, 2022
 * Given an n x n matrix mat[n][n] of integers, find the maximum value of mat(c, d) â€“ mat(a, b) over all choices of indexes such that both c > a and d > b.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * mat[N][N] = {{ 1, 2, -1, -4, -20 },
 *              { -8, -3, 4, 2, 1 },
 *              { 3, 8, 6, 1, 3 },
 *              { -4, -1, 1, 7, -6 },
 *              { 0, -4, 10, -5, 1 }};
 * Output: 18
 * The maximum value is 18 as mat[4][2]
 * - mat[1][0] = 18 has maximum difference.
 * The program should do only ONE traversal of the matrix. i.e. expected time complexity is O(n2)
 * A simple solution would be to apply Brute-Force. For all values mat(a, b) in the matrix, we find mat(c, d) that has maximum value such that c > a and d > b and keeps on updating maximum value found so far. We finally return the maximum value.
 *
 * Below is its implementation.
